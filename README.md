### Shop-redux

### User Story
As a business owner, I want to provide my customers with a complete e-commerce shopping experience. Customers should be able to see items, stock, and prices when they visit my business website. If they click to add an item to their cart, it should appear in their cart. When a user adds multiple items to their cart and then navigates away from the page, their cart items should still be there when they return. When a user places an order, I would also like credit card payments to be processed. They should see an order success page at that point.
